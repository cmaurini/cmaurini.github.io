My current research interests include stability of structures,
fracture and damage mechanics, computational mechanics,
plates and shells, large deformations and instabilities in soft solids.

The [H.D.R report](http://www.lmm.jussieu.fr/~corrado/articles/hdr-small.pdf) gives more details on my works in the period 2006-2014. You find below a short overview.

If you are further interested in my work please contact me by mail.


## Fracture and damage mechanics

I study fracture and damage mechanics in the framework of the variational approach
 to fracture. My interest focus on the links between gradient damage models and brittle fracture, and the use of damage models as phase-field models of fracture.
In a series of works, we have shown how crack nucleation can be studied  as a problem of structural instability and how the morphogenisis of complex crack patterns can be predicted by a bifurcation analysis.
I work also on numerical developments to improve the efficiency of the available HPC tecniques for phase-field models of fracture. I distribute several open-source codes to reproduce the results of my papers and, hopefully, serve as examples for others.

## Morphing structures

Slender structures may experience large global changes of their shape with small local deformations of the material. An emerging community of researchers proposes to benefit from geometrical nonlinearities to conceive structures able to hold multiple configurations of largely different shapes, each one associated to a specific functional regime. Similar systems are currently denoted as morphing, or shape-changing, structures. Their careful design can exploit geometric nonlinear effects to obtain great changes in shape through active materials with limited actuation power. Potential applications encompass aeronautics (shape-changing aerodynamic panels for flow control), energy (flexible and deployable solar cells), electronics (flexible and folding electronic devices), civil engineering (adaptive architecture including morphing functional elements), optics (shape-changing mirrors for active focusing), and microelectromechanical systems (micro-switches, mechanical memory cells, valves, micro-pumps).

In a series of works, we studied the multistable of shells and its dependence on on the material properties, the initial shape and the prestresses. We show how active materials (piezoelectric actuators) can be effectively used to control their shape.

## Piezoelectric structure and vibration control
During my Ph.D. I study the passive vibration control of mechanical structures trhough distributed piezoelectric transducers and resonant electric network. It the comporary terminology, we designed, fabricated and tested electromechanical meta-materials for dissipating mechanical vibrations in electric circuits. This kind of ideas recently received a renovated interest.
