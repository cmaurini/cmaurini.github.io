My current research interests include stability of structures,
fracture and damage mechanics, computational mechanics,
plates and shells, large deformations and instabilities in soft solids.

This page is under construction.

## Fracture and damage mechanics

I study variational phase-field models for brittle fracture.
I regard them as gradient damage models and I study aspect related to fracture nucleation, complex crack pattern, and the efficient numerical implementation of the theoretical models.

## Multistable plates and shells

## Nonlinear elasticity
