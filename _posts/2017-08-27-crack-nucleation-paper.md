Our work on crack nucleation in variational phase-field models is available
{% cite cm-a-2017-jmps --file cm-articles.bib%}.
We study gradient-damage models can be used as phase-field model of brittle fracture.
We show that they correctely account for crack nucleation when appropiately setting the internal length.
Several validation and verification numerical experiments are provided.
