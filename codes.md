- [*Basic computational methods for fracture mechanics using `dolfinx`*](https://gitlab.com/newfrac/CORE-school/newfrac-core-numerics#basic-computational-methods-for-fracture-mechanics) with Laura De Laurenzis, ETH Zurich, in the framework of the [Newfrac project](https://www.newfrac.eu)
  
- [*Training on dolfinx including nonlienear elasticity and phase-field fracture*](https://newfrac.gitlab.io/newfrac-fenicsx-training/), in collaboration with Jack Hale, University of Luxembourg, in the framework of the [Newfrac project](https://www.newfrac.eu).
  
- A tutorial as Jupyter notebooks that I use for short courses (with fenics-old, outdated), on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cmaurini/damage-course/blob/master/notebook/VarFrac.ipynb)
  
 - Supplementary material to {% cite cm-a-2017-jmps --file cm-articles.bib%}:
        [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage),
      where  you can find  a reasonably complete implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS

 - Supplementary material to {% cite cm-a-16-ijnme --file cm-articles.bib%} where you can find an advanced solver implemented using FEniCS and advanced features of PETSc [https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/varfrac-solvers](https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/varfrac-solvers)

 - Demo codes used at the cism-iutam summer school on variational fracture [http://www.cism.it/courses/C1304/](http://www.cism.it/courses/C1304/):
        [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism),
      where you can find elementary examples for the implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS (can be outdated but useful as a starting example).


- Strain-gradient damage, supplementary material to {% cite cm-a18-cmame --file cm-articles.bib%}: [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gd-vs-sd-damagemodels](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gd-vs-sd-damagemodels)

- Plates and shells, where we provide a simple and efficient implementation of shell models in FEniCS described in the paper {% cite cm-a19-cs --file cm-articles.bib%}
