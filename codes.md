- Gradient damage modela and variational phase field models of fracture and
    - Demo codes used at the cism-iutam summer school on variational fracture [http://www.cism.it/courses/C1304/]()

        (https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism)

      where you can elementary examples for the implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS

    - Supplementary material to {% cite cm-a-2017-jmps --file cm-articles.bib%}:

        [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage)

      where  can find  a reasonably complete implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS
