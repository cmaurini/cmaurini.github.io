- Gradient damage models and variational phase-field models of fracture
    
    - A tutorial as jupyter notebooks that I use for short courses: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/cmaurini/damage-course/blob/master/notebook/VarFrac.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cmaurini/damage-course/blob/master/notebook/VarFrac.ipynb)
  
    - Supplementary material to {% cite cm-a-2017-jmps --file cm-articles.bib%}:
        [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage),
      where  you can find  a reasonably complete implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS

    - Supplementary material to {% cite cm-a-16-ijnme --file cm-articles.bib%} where you can find an advanced solver implemented using FEniCS and advanced features of PETSc [https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/varfrac-solvers](https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/varfrac-solvers)

    - Demo codes used at the cism-iutam summer school on variational fracture [http://www.cism.it/courses/C1304/](http://www.cism.it/courses/C1304/):
        [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism),
      where you can find elementary examples for the implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS (can be outdated but useful as a starting example).


- Strain-gradient damage, supplementary material to {% cite cm-a18-cmame --file cm-articles.bib%}: [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gd-vs-sd-damagemodels](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gd-vs-sd-damagemodels)

- Plates and shells, where we provide a simple and efficient implementation of shell models in FEniCS described in the paper {% cite cm-a19-cs --file cm-articles.bib%}
