My current research interests include stability of structures,
fracture and damage mechanics, computational mechanics,
plates and shells, large deformations and instabilities in soft solids.

## Fracture and damage mechanics

I study variational phase-field models for brittle fracture.
I regard them as gradient damage models and I study aspect related to fracture nucleation, complex crack pattern, and the efficient numerical implementation of the theoretical models {% cite cm-a16-ijnme --prefix post1 %}

## Multistable plates and shells
## Nonlinear elasticity
