- Gradient damage models and variational phase-field models of fracture
    - Demo codes used at the cism-iutam summer school on variational fracture [http://www.cism.it/courses/C1304/](http://www.cism.it/courses/C1304/):
        [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/varfrac_for_cism),
      where you can elementary examples for the implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS

    - Supplementary material to {% cite cm-a-2017-jmps --file cm-articles.bib%}:
        [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gradient-damage),
      where  can find  a reasonably complete implementation of gradient-damage models in FEniCS

- Strain-gradient damage (supplementary material to a paper currently under review): [https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gd-vs-sd-damagemodels](https://bitbucket.org/cmaurini/gd-vs-sd-damagemodels)

- Plates and shells, where we are trying to provide a simple and efficient implementation of shell models in FEniCS
